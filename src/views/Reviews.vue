            <h2>Psychonauts 2</h2>
            <img src="..\assets\Psychonauts_2.png" alt="game1" class="img_responsive">     
            <h3>RATING: 8.5/10</h3>
              <p><strong>STORY</strong>
                Premise
                PN is framed as a summer camp adventure for gifted children. You take control of Raz as he trains at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp in order to fulfill his dream of becoming a Psychonaut, a psychic secret agent. The events of the game cover Raz's basic training, as well as his attempts to stop a psychic conspiracy lurking in the background.

                <strong>EXECUTION</strong>
                I found the story still held up after all these years. Playing the game really feels like being in a Saturday morning cartoon due to its energetic and cheeky tone guiding you through Raz's journey. The writing is pretty great and some jokes still got a chuckle out of me. Despite being full of tropes and cliches, PN's execution of them all creates a really unique experience.
                
                My only real complaints are that the villain's motivations could've been more explicit. Their reasons are only really told via optional collectables, which is frustrating. Nonetheless, the journey to the end was quite enjoyable and the biggest reason why I recommend PN.

            <h2>Hades</h2>
            <img src="..\assets\hades.jpg" alt="game2" class="img_responsive">   
            <h3>RATING: 9.5/10</h3>
            <p>In the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus, a poor soul is doomed to forever push a boulder uphill without rest. 
              Each time he’d push it up, it would roll back down again and he’d have to start anew. 
              But what if that Herculean climb uphill was actually awesome combat against a randomized variety of enemies as you fight your way out of Hell, 
              with a wide range of godly powers that grow and combine in interesting ways as you progress? 
              And what if, instead of going back to zero, you got a little stronger each time with some help from a colorful cast of allies and enemies who remember each of your attempts? 
              That’s Hades’ premise, and the Greek mythology-themed rogue-lite that developer Supergiant has built around it makes going to Hell a joy.
